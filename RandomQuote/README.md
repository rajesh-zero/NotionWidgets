# Random Quote Generator

This project displays a random quote from a curated list of quotes when the page is loaded or the refresh icon is clicked. The quotes are presented beautifully and the author's name is styled for better aesthetics. The project is a simple single-page static website made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Displays a random quote from a JSON array when the page is loaded.
- Refresh icon beside the author's name that, when clicked, changes the displayed quote.
- The refresh icon becomes visible only when the quote is hovered over and remains visible for 5 seconds.
- The author's name is italicized and font size is slightly smaller than the quote for aesthetic appeal.
